  kube-vip Modes
---

There are various technologies available to kube-vip that are all used in largely the same manner, to expose an IP address to a network or to update networking equipment so that they are aware of the path to direct traffic.
The different modes kube-vip supports are disjunctive to each other. This means you can only enable one of the modes.

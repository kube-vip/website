  kube-vip installation as a DaemonSet.
---

Some Kubernetes distributions can bring up a Kubernetes cluster without depending on a pre-existing VIP (but they may be configured to support one). A prime example of this would be K3s which can be configured to start and also sign the certificates to allow incoming traffic to a virtual IP. Given we don't need the VIP to exist before the cluster, we can bring up the K3s node(s) and then add kube-vip as a DaemonSet for all control plane nodes.

If the Kubernetes installer allows for adding a virtual IP as an additional [SAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_Alternative_Name) to the API server certificate, we can apply kube-vip to the cluster once the first node has been brought up.

Unlike running kube-vip as a [static Pod](/install_static) there are a few more things that may need configuring when running kube-vip as a DaemonSet. This page will cover primarily the differences.

## kube-vip as HA, Load Balancer, or both

The functionality of `kube-vip` depends on the flags used to create the Daemonset manifest. By passing in `--controlplane` we instruct `kube-vip` to provide and advertise a virtual IP to be used by the control plane. By passing in `--services` we tell `kube-vip` to provide load balancing for Kubernetes Service resources created inside the cluster. With both enabled, `kube-vip` will manage a virtual IP address that is passed through its configuration for a highly available Kubernetes cluster. It will also watch Services of type `LoadBalancer` and once their `service.metadata.annotations["kube-vip.io/loadbalancerIPs"]` or `spec.LoadBalancerIP` is updated (typically by a cloud controller, including (optionally) the one provided by kube-vip in [on-prem](/docs/usage/cloud-provider/) scenarios) it will advertise this address using BGP/ARP. In this example, we will use both when generating the manifest.

When in `routing table` mode, `kube-vip` can be configured to not use any kind of leader election. In such case every `kube-vip` instance will watch all the configured services and will configure routing if the node kube-vip instance is running on has an endpoint associated with the service. To achieve this, both `leaderElection` and `servicesElection` flags should *not* be set.

## Create the RBAC settings

Since kube-vip as a DaemonSet runs as a regular resource instead of a static Pod, it still needs the correct access to be able to watch Kubernetes Services and other objects. In order to do this, RBAC resources must be created which include a ServiceAccount, ClusterRole, and ClusterRoleBinding and can be applied this with the command:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://kube-vip.io/manifests/rbac.yaml
```

## Generating a Manifest

In order to create an easier experience of consuming the various functionality within kube-vip, we can use the kube-vip container itself to generate our static Pod manifest. We do this by running the kube-vip image as a container and passing in the various [flags](/docs/installation/flags/) for the capabilities we want to enable.

### Set configuration details

We use environment variables to predefine the values of the inputs to supply to kube-vip.

Set the `VIP` address to be used for the control plane:

`export VIP=192.168.0.40`

Set the `INTERFACE` name to the name of the interface on the control plane(s) which will announce the VIP. In many Linux distributions this can be found with the `ip a` command.

`export INTERFACE=ens160`

Get the latest version of the kube-vip release by parsing the GitHub API. This step requires that `jq` and `curl` are installed.

`KVVERSION=$(curl -sL https://api.github.com/repos/kube-vip/kube-vip/releases | jq -r ".[0].name")`

To set manually instead, find the desired [release tag](https://github.com/kube-vip/kube-vip/releases):

`export KVVERSION=v0.5.0`

### Creating the manifest

With the input values now set, we can pull and run the kube-vip image supplying it the desired flags and values. 

Depending on the container runtime, use one of the two aliased commands to create a kube-vip command which runs the kube-vip image as a container.

For containerd, run the below command:

`alias kube-vip="ctr image pull ghcr.io/kube-vip/kube-vip:$KVVERSION; ctr run --rm --net-host ghcr.io/kube-vip/kube-vip:$KVVERSION vip /kube-vip"`

For Docker, run the below command:

`alias kube-vip="docker run --network host --rm ghcr.io/kube-vip/kube-vip:$KVVERSION"`


### ARP Example for DaemonSet

When creating the kube-vip installation manifest as a DaemonSet, the `manifest` subcommand takes the value `daemonset` as opposed to the `pod` value. The flags `--inCluster` and `--taint` are also needed to configure the DaemonSet to use a ServiceAccount and affine the kube-vip Pods to control plane nodes thereby preventing them from running on worker instances.

```sh
kube-vip manifest daemonset \
    --interface $INTERFACE \
    --address $VIP \
    --inCluster \
    --taint \
    --controlplane \
    --services \
    --arp \
    --leaderElection
```

### BGP Example for DaemonSet

This configuration will create a manifest that starts kube-vip providing control plane VIP and Kubernetes Service management. Unlike ARP, all nodes in the BGP configuration will advertise virtual IP addresses.

**Note** we bind the address to `lo` as we don't want multiple devices that have the same address on public interfaces. We can specify all the peers in a comma-separated list in the format of `address:AS:password:multihop`.

`export INTERFACE=lo`

```sh
kube-vip manifest daemonset \
    --interface $INTERFACE \
    --address $VIP \
    --inCluster \
    --taint \
    --controlplane \
    --services \
    --bgp \
    --localAS 65000 \
    --bgpRouterID 192.168.0.2 \
    --bgppeers 192.168.0.10:65000::false,192.168.0.11:65000::false
```

```

#### Managing a `routerID` as a DaemonSet

The `routerID` needs to be unique on each node that participates in BGP advertisements. In order to do this, we can modify the manifest so that when kube-vip starts it will look up its local address and use that as the `routerID`. Add the following to the `env[]` array of the container:

```yaml
- name: bgp_routerinterface
  value: "ens160"
```
Alternatively, we can use the IP address of the pod itself as a unique value for the `routerID`:

```yaml
- name: bgp_routerid
  valueFrom:
    fieldRef:
      fieldPath: status.podIP
```

### DaemonSet Manifest Overview

Once the manifest for kube-vip as a DaemonSet is generated, these are some of the notable differences over the [static Pod](/install_static) manifest and their significance.

- `nodeSelector`: Ensures that DaemonSet Pods only run on control plane nodes.
- `serviceAccountName: kube-vip`: Specifies the ServiceAccount name that will be used to get/update Kubernetes Service resources.
- `tolerations`: Allows scheduling to control plane nodes that normally specify `NoSchedule` or `NoExecute` taints.
